## For Contributors

To sync up to Material Design and PX Blue's latest icon meta file, open Component Stickersheet's icon page (I suggest doing this from a [Figma branch](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360063144053-Create-branches-and-merge-changes)), link to this plugin's `manifest.json`, and do `yarn && yarn build`.
