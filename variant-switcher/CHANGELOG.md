# Changelog

## v2.0.0 (June 25, 2021)

### Added

-   When an instance is switched to the specified "To Variant", you can now choose to perform a "deep switch" to decide whether this plugin should keep looking into its child layers or not. This is helpful when you built dark-themed components using light-themed components, and don't want the plugin to "over-switch".
-   Ability to switch variants by pressing the "Enter" key.

### Changed

-   When an instance already has the specified "To Variant" property value, no variant switching will be performed.

## v1.0.0 (May 12, 2021)

### Added

-   Initial Release
